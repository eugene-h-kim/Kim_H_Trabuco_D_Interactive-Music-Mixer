# Animal Band Music Mixer

The focus of this project is to collaboratively research, experiment with and ultimately design and build a multimedia application using design and motion tools as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Your team will implement drag and drop functionality to load audio clips and create a dynamic audio experience, trigger animation, and play a compiled audio track.
